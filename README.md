    this is the start of my gardening log project. the aim is to create an application users can sign into and make daily logs of their gardens. 
    -These logs should include the following:
        a date time
        pictures if the user wants
        a description
        the ability to make sub logs for seperate garden beds
    -the user should be able to look at a collection of all their log entries as a calendar image or as a list
    -all the information needs to be stored server side.
    -from this day forward all days work and future needs must be documented in this read me file with the corresponding date
